This project was inspired by this dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mabelhsu/api-clean-top-1000-youtubers-statistics

Used it to study some basic EDA.

Some of the questions answered:
    What country has the most channels in top 1000?
    What categories do most channels cover in the top 1000? And only in brazilian channels?
    What are the means of visits, like and comments of these channels, per country?
    Is there any correlation between number of subscribers and visits/likes/comments?
